class MerkleTree(object):
    """
    Represents a Merkle Tree, a data structure used for efficiently summarizing and verifying the
    integrity of large sets of data. The Merkle Tree is a binary tree where each leaf node is the hash
    of a data block and every non-leaf node is the hash of its children nodes.

    Attributes:
        hash_function (callable): The hash function used for generating hashes of the blocks
                                  and non-leaf nodes in the Merkle Tree.
        leaves (list): A list where each element is a bytearray representing the hashed value of a leaf.
        levels (list of lists): A list of lists where each sublist represents a level of the tree, starting
                                from the leaves up to the root.
        is_ready (bool): Indicates whether the tree has been fully constructed and is ready to provide
                         the Merkle root and proofs.

    Methods:
        add_leaf(values, do_hash=False): Adds one or multiple leaves to the tree. If `do_hash` is True,
                                         it will hash the values before adding them as leaves.
        get_leaf(index): Retrieves the hexadecimal string representation of a leaf at the given index.
        get_leaf_count(): Returns the total number of leaves in the tree.
        get_tree_ready_state(): Checks if the tree has been fully constructed.
        make_tree(): Constructs the Merkle Tree from the current leaves. This method must be called
                     after all leaves are added and before retrieving the Merkle root or proofs.
        get_merkle_root(): Retrieves the Merkle root as a hexadecimal string if the tree is ready.
        get_proof(index): Generates a proof of inclusion for the leaf at the given index. This proof
                          consists of a list of sibling hashes that, when combined with the target leaf,
                          can reproduce the Merkle root.
        update_leaf(index, new_value): Updates the value of the leaf at the given index with `new_value`
                                      and recalculates the hashes up the tree to reflect this change.
        serialize(): Converts the Merkle Tree into a JSON-formatted string for storage or transmission.
        deserialize(json_data, hash_type="sha3_256"): Reconstructs the Merkle Tree from a JSON string,
                                                      using the specified hash function.

    Raises:
        Exception: If the `hash_type` provided during initialization is not supported or recognized.

    Example:
        # Create a Merkle tree using the SHA3-256 hash function
        merkle_tree = MerkleTree(hash_type='sha3_256')

        # Add data blocks (as leaves) to the tree
        merkle_tree.add_leaf(['block1', 'block2', 'block3'], do_hash=True)

        # Construct the tree
        merkle_tree.make_tree()

        # Retrieve the Merkle root
        root = merkle_tree.get_merkle_root()

        # Get proof of inclusion for the first data block
        proof = merkle_tree.get_proof(0)

        # Update the value of the first leaf and reconstruct the tree
        merkle_tree.update_leaf(0, 'new_block1_hashed_value')
        merkle_tree.make_tree()

        # Serialize the tree for storage
        serialized_tree = merkle_tree.serialize()

        # Deserialize the tree for later use
        deserialized_tree = MerkleTree.deserialize(serialized_tree, hash_type='sha3_256')

    Note:
        The hash_function attribute is determined by the hash_type parameter provided at initialization.
        Only hash types supported by the `hashlib` library can be used. Attempting to use an unsupported
        hash type will result in an exception.

        Generates the proof for the existence of a leaf at the specified index within the Merkle Tree.

        A Merkle proof is a collection of sibling hashes on the path from a leaf to the root of the tree.
        This proof can be used to independently verify that a leaf is indeed part of the Merkle tree without
        needing the entire tree. Each element of the proof shows the direction ('left' or 'right') and the
        corresponding hash that pairs with the path to the root.

        Parameters:
            index (int): The index of the target leaf for which to generate the Merkle proof. The index must
                         correspond to the position of the leaf in the original list of leaves when the tree
                         was constructed.

            list of dicts: A list where each dictionary contains a single key-value pair. The key is either
                           'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the sibling hash, and the value is a
                           string representing the hexadecimal hash value of the sibling. If the tree is not

    A Merkle proof is a sequence of hashes that, when combined with the target hash through the hash function
